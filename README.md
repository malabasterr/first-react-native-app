My first attempt at creating a mobile app with React Native.

This app is to be part of a birthday treasure hunt for a friend, asking users for answers to clues and giving the next part of their treasure hunt in return.


MADDY YOU NEED TO ADD AN IMAGE TO BE THE APP ICON ONCE DOWNLOADED ON A PHONE. ALSO IT SAYS THERE IS A BUG SO THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED BEFORE THE APP WILL WORK.
